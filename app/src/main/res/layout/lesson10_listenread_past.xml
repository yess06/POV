Terry the toad has wanted a green Ferrari, a bright green Ferrari since he was very young. But he has never had money. This has been a problem for Terry since he was young until now. He has always wanted a Ferrari during this entire time. He has dreamed about getting a bright, green Ferrari since he was young. And, since he was young, Terry has lived in Miami, Florida. Well, one day he went to a Ferrari dealer in Miami. And he said, “I want a fast, bright green, brand new Ferrari.” He asked the dealer, “How much is a Ferrari?” And the dealer said, “$97,000 for a brand new, bright green Ferrari.” Terry said, “Jeez, that’s expensive. Can I have a loan?” The Ferrari dealer said, “Listen, you’ll pay through the nose if you get a loan. It’s very expensive. Cash is much cheaper.” But there was one problem, of course. Terry the toad had no cash. So Terry went to Everglade Swamp. And every day he caught flies. Terry caught 20.7 billion flies. Then he sold them to Bill Gates. Bill Gates paid him $97,210. Terry immediately went to the Ferrari dealer. And he bought a brand new, bright green, super fast, Ferrari. He was very happy. He was a very, very happy toad."
